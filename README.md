### **What does this program do?**

"PWC" or the same "Play with characters" Is a graphical program used to encrypt texts.</br>
This program only supports texts and with it you can convert your texts to numbers</br>
You must use "seed" to create the ciphertexts</br>
In this app "seed" is used to translate encrypted texts or to create ciphertexts</br>
All "seed"s are unique and none is like the other</br>

#### **Example:**

If you want to encrypt the text of "Crows Tower"

Our text will be encrypted this way :

|Text|Seed|Code|
|----|----|----|
|Hello|0024|435281873408911657911657027845|

|H|e|l|l|o|
|----|----|----|----|----|
|435281|873408|911657|911657|027845|

</br>

For example, I put "seed" here as empty and encrypt the word "Crows Tower" like this, and you can get the same encryption by leaving "seed" blank.
